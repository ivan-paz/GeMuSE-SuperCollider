# SuperCollider script to perform parameter exploration together with the Geometric Multi-parameter Space Exploration interface "GeMuSE"

This script is a SuperCollider implementation that, together with the Geometric Multi-parameter Space Exploration interface ( GeMuSE, located at: https://github.com/laliki/GeMuSe ) allows the perceptual exploration of the parameter space of an algorithmic system (in this case stored at the Ndef( \x, {object} ) ).

Parameter space is understood as the set of all possible parameter combinations, of an algorithmic composition system, that determine the aural space created by the system.
By perceptual exploration I refer to the process of audition and subjective classification performed by the performer/composer/user by changing the parameter values of an algorithmic system.

During the exploration the user classify the combinations of parameters into perceptual classes. These could be, for example, outputs that can be used for different parts of a musical piece. Then, the parameter sets, together with the perceptual user evaluation, are considered as input/output relations. Such relations are processed, iteratively searching for regularities and thereby compressing the data to extract human readable and interpretable (if-then) rules able to represent musical entities of low and high-level. This process is carried out by the exploring-parameters algorithm (implemented in SuperCollider by Iv√°n Paz and Julian Rohrhuber and available at https://github.com/musikinformatik/exploring-parameters ).
The exploring-parameters algorithm is used to compress the data into if-then rules that are used in a generative form throughout a simple Tdef.

## Multi-threshold compression
Alternatively, it is possible to use, for each parameter, different thresholds for different intervals. This functionality allow to control the ammount of variation among the values inside the rules depending on the range of the parameter that they describe.
This is done with the gemuseSuperCollider\_multithreshold.scd script. In the following code, for hypotetical parameters 1 and 2 the compression thresholds are set as follows: For parameter 1 from 0 to inf the threshold is set equal to 1000. For parameter 2 from 0 to 10 the threshold is set to 5, while from 10 to inf the threshold has been set to 200. It is possible to define as many thresholds and intervals as we want. 
```
~intervals_and_distances = [
      [

              [ [0, inf],  1000]

      ],

      [

              [ [0, 10], 5 ], [ [10, inf], 200 ]
      ]
])
```
